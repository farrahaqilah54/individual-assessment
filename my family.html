We don't have any grandfathers but we have two grandmas. They are old woman and love us very much. One of them lives in our city in her own house with a garden. We meet with her a few times a week. Another one lives in the countryside. We visit her every month, sometimes more often.

It is such a blessed, born in a lovely family.
